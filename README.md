# rl-pong

A dive into reinforcement learning and raylib with one simple goal, play pong against an RL agent.


This project contains two subprojects **rl-pong-game** and **rl-pong-learn**  (subject to change)

 - **rl-pong-game** is an implementation of pong made with raylib using c++ 

 - **rl-pong-learn** uses *X* and *Y* to do *Z* ðŸ«
